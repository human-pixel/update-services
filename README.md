# Update Services

**INACTIVE NOTICE: This plugin is unsupported by WPMUDEV, we've published it here for those technical types who might want to fork and maintain it for their needs.**

## Update Services adds the 'Update Services' box to WordPress Multisite.

Multisite automatically removes the update services box from the **Settings > Writing **page found in WordPress. This plugin adds it back *AND* allows super admins to configure default services across an entire network. It gives you back the functionality to update different sites when you publish a new post.  It also adds in new functionality (at the bottom of **Network Admin > Settings**) for super admins to configure additional/different default update services.

### To use go to:

1.  **Network Admin > Settings (for network) or Dashboard>Writing (for site)**
2.  Scroll down to Update Services
3.  Add each service on a separate line
4.  Click **Save Changes**
